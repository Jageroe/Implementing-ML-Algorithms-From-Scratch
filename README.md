# Implementing ML algorithms from scratch
This repository contains implementations of basic machine learning algorithms without using ML libraries like sklearn.

These implementations are intended for my own educational purposes, to gain hands-on experience and refresh my understanding of the fundamental principles behind these machine learning algorithms.

### Implemented Algorithms


1. **Decision Trees:** Both for regression and classification problems.
